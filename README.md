## 📊 Dataset  

- **Source:** [Mention dataset source or link]  
- **Description:** Briefly explain what the dataset contains (e.g., renewable energy production, consumption, region-wise statistics).  
- **Size:** Number of rows/columns  

---

## 🧠 Methodology  

1. **Data Cleaning** – Handling missing values, duplicates, and formatting.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualization of renewable energy patterns and trends.  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Creation of meaningful variables.  
4. **Modeling (if applicable)** – Machine learning/deep learning approach used.  
5. **Evaluation** – Metrics such as accuracy, RMSE, R², etc.

## 📈 Results  

- Key insights from the analysis  
- Model performance summary  
- Visualization highlights (insert graphs/screenshots if needed)  

---

## 🚀 Usage  

Run the Jupyter Notebook:  
```bash
jupyter notebook renewable_energy.ipynb
```

If scripts are available, run them like:  
```bash
python script_name.py
```
